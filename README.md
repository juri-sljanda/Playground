# Playground
home assignment
A simple test which creates a new book with all fields filled
Verifying that the book is in the library
Cleaning up after itself by deleting the created record
The values are hardcoded, although could be parsed from JSON file with proper libraries used.
Default browser for Selenide is Firefox, i have changed the configuration to Chrome. Left the BeforeTest open, because you can later specify the browser in the command line in Babmoo.
